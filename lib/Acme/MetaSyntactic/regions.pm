=head1 NAME

Acme::MetaSyntactic::regions - Administrative country subdivisions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most countries have administrative subdivisions, sometimes more than one
level deep. This theme lists the first level of administrative divisions
for a number of countries.

Depending on the country, they have differente names: regions, provinces,
states, districts, emirates, parishes, dependencies, etc.

The main source for finding lists of regions is the ISO 3166-2
standard (I<Codes for the representation of names of countries
and their subdivisions -- Part 2: Country subdivision code>). See
L<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2>.
