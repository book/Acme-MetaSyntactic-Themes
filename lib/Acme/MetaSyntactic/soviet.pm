=head1 IMPORTANT NOTE

The contributor would like to give the following warning and rant.

I have used only sources published in 1990 or earlier. I have done
so to avoid the use of the "ex-" prefix. I am fed up with the silly
practice which appeared in 1991 or so, consisting in prefixing
everything Soviet and Jugoslavian with "ex-". You could even find
sentences such as: "On June 22nd, 1941, the Third Reich attacked
the ex-USSR. On the first week, several hundred thousand soldiers
from the ex-Red Army were taken prisoners by the Wehrmacht."
This is particularly stupid since the Red Army and the USSR outlasted
the Third Reich and the Wehrmacht by 45 years.
