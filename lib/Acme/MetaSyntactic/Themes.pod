=head1 NAME

Acme::MetaSyntactic::Themes - The original Acme::MetaSyntactic themes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::MetaSyntactic qw( batman );
    print metabatman;    # kapow

=head1 DESCRIPTION

From January 2005 to November 2006, I have published a CPAN distribution
a week, including new themes for L<Acme::MetaSyntactic> (almost) every week.

In 2012, with the version 1.000 of L<Acme::MetaSyntactic>, I have split
the core modules (that provide the list behaviour) from the actual themes,
making the distribution containing the very stable L<Acme::MetaSyntactic>
modules driving its behaviour a lot thinner.

When Acme-MetaSyntactic 0.99 was published in November 2006, the
distribution contained 99 themes. The full list of theme and the date
of their inclusion in the distribution is documented below:

This distribution contains all the above themes, except the themes C<any>
(which picks up I<any> installed theme) and C<foo> (the default theme).

This distribution also contains several themes proposed during the
years 2005-2006, but that couldn't be included due to self-imposed
limits (I wanted to have 99 themes in version 0.99).

For version 1.000, these themes are: C<abba>, C<zodiac>.
Due to a timely coincidence, another new theme has been added:
C<french_presidents>. Thus bringing it to a total of 100 themes.

    2012-05-07    1.000   abba, french_presidents, zodiac

Future releases will only contain themes proposed in the pre-1.000 era,
as well as updates to the themes already in the distribution.

With that last theme, I have reached the end of my I<backlog>,
having finally published all themes that were sent to me during
the great hours of L<Acme::MetaSyntactic>.
Future versions will only contain updates and bug fixes, but no
new themes.

Do not send me new themes for inclusion in this distribution.
Your themes should be distributed in their own distribution
(see for example
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic::buzzwords>,
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic::daleks>,
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic::errno>,
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic::morning_musume>,
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic::nethack>,
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic::soviet>,
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic::vim>,
and L<Acme::MetaSyntactic::Themes::Abigail>).

To make your own Acme::MetaSyntactic theme distribution, you can
take example from this distribution. Have a look at the F<t/>
directory in particular.

L<Task::MetaSyntactic> is a L<Task> designed to install all available
L<Acme::MetaSyntactic> themes. Please contact the task maintainer if
you want it to include your theme.
