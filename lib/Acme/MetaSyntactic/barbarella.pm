According to L<http://www.hollywoodcomics.com/forestbbd.html>, 
Jean-Claude Forest created the character of Barbarella for I<V-Magazine>

translated in a dozen countries. Not long after, it was adapted into
a major motion picture, starring Jane Fonda, for which Forest acted as
design consultant.

This theme lists the main characters from the 1968 movie, I<Barbarella>,
starring Jane Fonda.
